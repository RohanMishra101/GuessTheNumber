              <p>Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. The word is represented by a series of blank spaces, with each blank representing a letter in the word. The player guesses one letter at a time, and if the letter is in the word, it is revealed in its correct position.</p>
